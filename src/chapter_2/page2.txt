Sometimes
it can be tricky to determine if you should be using
"me" or "I" in a sentence. Use the pronoun "I" when the person

speaking is doing the action, either alone or with someone else.

Use the pronoun "me" when the person speaking is receiving the action of the verb in some way, either directly or indirectly. It can be difficult to know which one to use when a sentence has a compound subject or object, especially since many people use "me" in subject position and "I" in object position
 in speechâ€”and this is OK to do in informal settings.
